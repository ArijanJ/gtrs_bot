This is a little node.js discord bot that adds some functionality from gametracker.rs
You can translate most of the strings in translation.json, I don't know why 'ip' is in the json file,
it shouldn't be but it is, so whatever.

Current commands are 'banner' and 'time'.
Banner returns the gametracker.rs banner of a server currently, and you can use 'time [player]' to check the
playtime of a player.
